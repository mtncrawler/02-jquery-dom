## Overview
A site is needed to display blog posts on a page with the title, author, text, images, and days since published, with the most recent article posted on top. 

## Getting Started
The site will be built using existing code to meet all user story requirements. The article data and some functions are started, but require using jQuery and DOM manipulation to build and design the site.

## Architecture
The site will use JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS to build and design the page. Live-server was used in the development process.
